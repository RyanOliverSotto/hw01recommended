                        <p> My first Bachelors in Science was in psychology. I was always interested in theories that involved
                            motivation, cognition, and emotions. Let me bring up a theory I recall learning because I recently
                            experienced this phenomenon in 2016; it's called flashbulb memory. "A flashbulb memory is a highly
                            detailed, exceptionally vivid 'snapshot' of the moment and circumstances in which a piece of
                            surprising and consequential (or emotionally arousing) news was heard." I have had instances
                            of flashbulb memories dotted in various events in my life.</p>
                        <p> I can recall exact details of where I was, what I was doing, the weather, when the Space Shuttle
                            Challenger exploded (yes I am old.) I can recall every detail about my circumstances when I learned
                            about the sudden passing of my beloved grandfather when I was in my 20's. I recall bright and
                            vivid details when I came to learn about the deaths of Michael Jackson, Prince, and George Michael.
                            Moving forward in time, I can recall the very moment, when I learned that the job I held for
                            15+ years, the job that defined me, provided me steady income, and encapsulated my entire existence
                            for over a decade was soon to end. I was working remotely that sunny early spring afternoon.
                            It was one of those atypical Chicago days with temperatures soaring higher than usual for the
                            season. I had opened the windows to dispel the stale air of my home office. I was about to wrap
                            up my day and prepare for tomorrow's agendas when I saw at 3:46PM CST, a meeting invite in my
                            Outlook. The participants were only me, my supervisor Catherine, and an unknown associate Crystal,
                            whom I looked up in our resource library as an HR rep from our HQ in St Louis. I knew immediately
                            something was amiss. I quickly instant messaged my boss.</p>

                        <blockquote>Me: "Cat, is everything all right? I see I have a meeting with you in 15 minutes."</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>Cat: "Ryan, I'm afraid it's bad news."</blockquote>

                        <p> I know thousands of Americans have been laid off, but this event hit me very hard. I have had the
                            good fortune of lasting at the compnay as long as I did and achieving the accomplishments I have
                            earned. I could have easily gotten depressed and begin a fast downward spiral into madness, but
                            not I. April 26th 2016 was the last time I clocked in as the team lead of SCRM, the position
                            I held for years. It was time for some new beginnings. Coicidentally, PokeMon Go debutted the
                            very same season as my lay off. I have some pretty rare Pokemon and a cracked IPhone to prove
                            it. There is that overstated saying, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." I know's it's
                            <em>cliche</em>, but it doesn't diminish the power of its simple philosphy. And make lemonaid I did,
                            gallons. I was able to secure a 10k grant to return to school for some retraining where was I
                            able to leverage my experience and education to obtain several flavors of IT Project Management
                            certifications. I immersed myself in the professional PM community here in Chicago, meeting so
                            many wonderful new associates, some of whom I now consider friends. My curiosity doesn't end
                            with project management. I was always interested in learning about website development and coding.
                            When I came to learn about Northwestern's fullstack coding bootcamp, I jumped on the opportunity.
                            Maybe I can insert myself into the development ecosystem as I have in project management. I think
                            the two would be a wonderful marriage of skillsets and expertise.</p>

                        <p> So yes, maybe when I receive my certificate of completion from this program, a new flashbulb memory
                            will be logged in my mind.</p>
