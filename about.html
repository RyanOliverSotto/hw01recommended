            <h3>About me</h3>
            <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHQdYRKzPCaFQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1526504400&v=alpha&t=28J3O54iPaPi-dyxeFZZu9im1ZuX3oWIoa4hPqlk19M"

            <p> My first Bachelors in Science was in psychology. I was always interested in theories that involved motivation,
                cognition, and emotions. Let me bring up a theory I recall learning because I recently experienced this phenomenon
                in 2016; it's called flashbulb memory. "A flashbulb memory is a highly detailed, exceptionally vivid 'snapshot'
                of the moment and circumstances in which a piece of surprising and consequential (or emotionally arousing)
                news was heard." I have had instances of flashbulb memories dotted in various events in my life.</p>
            <p> I can recall exact details of where I was, what I was doing, the weather, when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded
                (yes I am old.) I can recall every detail about my circumstances when I learned about the sudden passing
                of my beloved grandfather when I was in my 20's. I recall bright and vivid details when I came to learn about
                the deaths of Michael Jackson, Prince, and George Michael. Moving forward in time, I can recall the very
                moment, when I learned that the job I held for 15+ years, the job that defined me, provided me steady income,
                and encapsulated my entire existence for over a decade was soon to end. I was working remotely that sunny
                early spring afternoon. It was one of those atypical Chicago days with temperatures soaring higher than usual
                for the season. I had opened the windows to dispel the stale air of my home office. I was about to wrap up
                my day and prepare for tomorrow's agendas when I saw at 3:46PM CST, a meeting invite in my Outlook. The participants
                were only me, my supervisor Catherine, and an unknown associate Crystal, whom I looked up in our resource
                library as an HR rep from our HQ in St Louis. I knew immediately something was amiss. I quickly instant messaged
                my boss.</p>

            <blockquote>Me: "Cat, is everything all right? I see I have a meeting with you in 15 minutes." Cat: "Ryan, I'm afraid it's
                bad news."</blockquote>

            <p> I know. Thousands of Americans have been laid off. I have had the good fortune of lasting as long as I did and
                achieving the accomplishments I have earned. I could have easily gotten depressed and begin a fast downward
                spiral into madness, but not I. April 26th 2016 was the last time I clocked in as the team lead of SCRM,
                the position I held for years. It was time for some new beginnings. Coicidentally, PokeMon Go debutted the
                very same season as my lay off. I have some pretty rare Pokemon and a cracked IPhone to prove it.There is
                that overstated saying, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." I know's its over used, but it doesn't
                diminish the power of it's simple philosphy. And make lemonaid I did, gallons. I was able to secure a 10k
                grant to return to school for some retraining where was I able to leverage my experience and education to
                obtain several flavors of IT Project Management certifications. I immersed myself in the professional PM
                community here in Chicago, meeting so many wonderful new associates, some of whom I now consider friends.
                My curiosity doesn't end with project management. I was always interested in learning about website development
                and coding. When I came to learn about Northwestern's fullstack coding bootcamp, I jumped on the opportunity.
                Maybe I can insert myself into the development ecosystem as I have in project management. I think the two
                would be a wonderful marriage of skillsets and expertise.</p>

            <p> So yes, maybe when I receive my certificate of completion from this program, a new flashbulb memory will be logged
                in my mind.</p>
