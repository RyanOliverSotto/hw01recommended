            <p>    My first Bachelors in Science was in psychology. I was always interested in theories that involved motivation, cognition, and emotions. Let me bring up a theory I recall learning
                    because I recently experienced this phenomenon in 2016; it's called flashbulb memory. "A flashbulb memory is a highly detailed, exceptionally vivid 'snapshot' of the moment
                    and circumstances in which a piece of surprising and consequential (or emotionally arousing) news was heard." I have had instances of flashbulb memories dotted in various events 
                    in my life.</p>
                    <p>     I can recall exact details of where I was, what I was doing, the weather, when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded (yes I am old.) I can recall every detail about
                    my circumstances when I learned about the sudden passing of my beloved grandfather when I was in my 20's. I recall bright and vivid details when I 
                    came to learn about the deaths of Michael Jackson, Prince, and George Michael. Moving forward in time, I can recall the very moment, when I learned that the job I held
                    for 15+ years, the job that defined me, provided me steady income, and encapsulated my entire existence for over a decade was soon to end. 
                    I was working remotely that sunny early spring afternoon. It was one of those atypical Chicago days with temperatures soaring higher than usual for the season. I had opened the 
                    windows to dispel the stale air of my home office. I was about to wrap up my day and prepare for tomorrow's agendas when I saw at 3:46PM CST, a meeting invite in my Outlook.
                    The participants were only me, my supervisor Catherine, and an unknown associate Crystal, whom I looked up in our resource library as an HR rep from our HQ in St Louis. I knew 
                    immediately something was amiss. I quickly instant messaged my boss.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>Me: "Cat, is everything all right? I see I have a meeting with you in 15 minutes."</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Cat: "Ryan, I'm afraid it's bad news."</blockquote>
           
                    <p>    I know thousands of Americans have been laid off, but this event hit me very hard. I have had the good fortune of lasting at the compnay as long as I did and achieving the accomplishments I have earned. I could have easily
                    gotten depressed and begin a fast downward spiral into madness, but not I. April 26th 2016 was the last time I clocked in as the team lead of SCRM, the position I held for years.
                    It was time for some new beginnings. Coicidentally, PokeMon Go debutted the very same season as my lay off. I have some pretty rare Pokemon and a cracked IPhone to prove it. There 
                    is that overstated saying, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." I know's it's <em>cliche</em>, but it doesn't diminish the power of its simple philosphy. And make lemonaid I
                    did, gallons. I was able to secure a 10k grant to return to school for some retraining where was I able to leverage my experience and education to obtain several flavors of
                    IT Project Management certifications. I immersed myself in the professional PM community here in Chicago, meeting so many wonderful new associates, some of whom I now consider 
                    friends. My curiosity doesn't end with project management. I was always interested in learning about website development and coding. When I came to learn about Northwestern's
                    fullstack coding bootcamp, I jumped on the opportunity. Maybe I can insert myself into the development ecosystem as I have in project management. I think the two would be a 
                    wonderful marriage of skillsets and expertise.</p>
                    
                    <p>    So yes, maybe when I receive my certificate of completion from this program, a new flashbulb memory will be logged in my mind.</p>        </section>
